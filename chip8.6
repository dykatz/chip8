.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm chip8
.Ar game
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The game
.Nm
plays a CHIP-8 ROM. It will appear in its own window.
.Sh CONTROLS
CHIP-8 uses a 16 key keypad that does not correspond to the way a normal
keyboard is layed out. The keys are the hexedecimal digits (0-9, A-F), and
layed out as follows:
.Bl -column
.It C Ta D Ta E Ta F
.It 8 Ta 9 Ta A Ta B
.It 4 Ta 5 Ta 6 Ta 7
.It 0 Ta 1 Ta 2 Ta 3
.El
These are mapped to the rightmost 16 keys on the standard QWERTY keyboard:
.Bl -column
.It 1 Ta 2 Ta 3 Ta 4
.It Q Ta W Ta E Ta R
.It A Ta S Ta D Ta F
.It Z Ta X Ta C Ta V
.El
Unfortunately, this is hardcoded at compile time.
